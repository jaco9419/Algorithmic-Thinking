## Graph Theory

### Algorithm Efficienvy - Measurement

Time

Space (memory)

### Brute Force
Simplest solution, but not necessarily the most efficient

### Paths and distances

### Directed Graphs
Direction does not matter. Represented with {} because the order is not important. {0,1} = {1,0}.

They have in and out degree nodes.

<pre><code>g = (v, e)
v = {0,1,2,3}
e = {{0,1}, {1,2}, {2,3}, {3,0}}</code></pre>

### Undirected Graphs

They only have degree nodes.

<pre><code>g = (v, e)
v = {0,1,2,3}
e = {(0,1), (2,1), (3,1)}</code></pre>

## 5 Steps:

1- Understanding the problem.<br>
2- Formulating the problem. <br>
3- Developing an algorithm. <br>
4- Implementing the algorithm. <br>
5- Running it on the data and answering the original question.<br>
